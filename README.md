# Horiseon Accesssibility project
Horiseon Accessibilty changes

# Description

The reason for this project was to make an exisitng site more accessible to the visually impaired.
I believe this was achieved in a number of ways, e.g adding alts for images and icons and replacing pixels with rem for the font-size.

The languages used in this were HTML and CSS as the sute did not have much interactivity Javascript was not needed.
